# cpp-alloctrack: Light-weight Dynamic Memory Allocation Tracker Library for C++

Pointers can make memory hard to track. In complex programs, it can daunting to find memory leaks. This allocation library is designed to combat these struggles.

This C++ library takes advantage of the fact that C++ uses a different methods for dynnamically allocating memory than C and of the fact that C++ builds upon C. It is designed to be very compact and simple. This library exceeds and shines in environments that are not an IDE.

cpp-alloctrack aims to use only the basic libraries included in most if not all cpp compilers for it's implementation.

## Installation

To put plainly, one just has to drag the ['library file'](alloctrack.hpp) to a currently working environment, include the file in the program's driver file, and run desired allocation commands.

### Prerequisites

* A C++ Compiler, [recommended installation](https://hank.feild.org/courses/common/cpp-compiler.html#compiler-linux)
